# HabEths
Condition yourself into forming new habits and breaking old ones. Stake some Ethereum to commit to your new habit, and earn some back as you accomplish daily checkpoints. If you don't meet your checkpoint, your stake for the day will get sent to the network pool.

## How it works

1. Connect with your Rinkeby Ethereum Address (get test Eth from faucet)

2. Choose a habits

3. Connect your supervisor's Rinkeby Ethereum Address

4. Stake some ETH

5. Everyday, get your supervisor to mark you as approved or rejected. Make sure you choose someone reliable and trustworthy as your supervisor. You always run the risk of choosing a jerk who'll reject you all the time otherwise.
